This is a folder containing different examples for my in-class presentation.

The descriptions are as follows:

1
--
A simple model with two trains and two stations, running over 2 hours. 
To show the properties of the system and how to understand the data readout.

2
--
Same as 1, but run over all 20 hours.
Shows how the trains experience bunching.

3
--
Same as 2, but with dispatching. 
Shows how dispatch management can improve quality of service.

4
--
4 Stations, 4 trains with dispatching.
Shows that the system can be expandable.

5
--
Same as 4, but with no dispatching.
Shows that even headway is unstable.
